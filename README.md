## Problem

In today's world, carelessly browsing the internet can be dangerous. Due to the rise of phishing and scamming attempts, people are losing out on time and money. Majority of the phishing attempts use big name brands such as Google, Apple, Paypal, and etc.. It's easy for many people to glance at a big name brand's logo and immediately trust the site.

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, MySQL, Node.js, Jquery, UNIX, Regedicts. 

The frameworks we used were:

## Challenges

There were a lot of challenges that we faced during this hackathon. We ran into issue with implementing the Worpress site. Converting different image types to image types that google vision supports. Researching and developing the webscraper for our backend. Overall, using unfamiliar technologies and languages which led to a lot of researching and confusion.

## What we learned

Learned the basics on using new languages and technologies. 

## The future

Improving on detection of phishing sites and creating a sign in/up function for our users.
